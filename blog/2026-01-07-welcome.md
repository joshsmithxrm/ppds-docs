<!-- SESSION:
## Status
- Intro: DONE (tightened, Option B applied)
- Why PPDS Exists: RAW DUMP - needs shaping
- What This Is: NOT STARTED
- What's Next: NOT STARTED

## Decisions Made
- First commit: December 13, 2025 (confirmed from git log)
- Rick & Morty "doesn't cut the Chut": VALID (S5E5 Bruce Chutback)
- CMT dig: OK - frame as "tools built for different era" not "Microsoft bad"
- Tone: Conversational, not resume
- Save "journey" story (3 rewrites, VS Code extension pivot) for separate "workflow" post

## Themes for "Why PPDS Exists"
- Epiphany: Web API was fighting me -> SDK made it click -> Claude let me ship fast
- Core message: "bridge gaps where people waste time" / "time is finite"
- Building in the open, will ship bugs, iterate > perfect

## Next Session: Work On
1. Shape "Why PPDS Exists" from raw dump (use epiphany as hook)
2. Write "What This Is" (feature list goes here)
3. Write "What's Next" (call to action - star repo? try it?)

## Raw Input Location
See HTML comment below "Why PPDS Exists" heading - preserved for reference

I'm Josh Smith, a Principal Technical Architect at Hitachi Solutions. I started at Microsoft in 2011 on the CRM Support team (troubleshooting everything from Email Router to CRM 3.0), worked data migrations, then joined FieldOne and implemented Field Service for customers before the Microsoft acquisition. Post-acquisition, I moved through Fast Track, the Dynamics 365 Rangers, and the Dynamics Operations Center handling platform incidents and outages before joining Hitachi in 2019.

I'm also a nerd who loves building tools.

## Why PPDS Exists

<!-- YOUR RAW INPUT (preserved):
I started working on PPDS [first commit date] and made my first commit. Before that I was working on a different earlier version of PPDS but it was written in typescript and it had repositories and leveraged web api for connection but, in december i had an epiphany that if i just abstracted out the functions better and added some more best practices to it and made it a different way, i could have a tool that would allow me to manage and work on deployments, implement best practices, view solutions, import jobs, web resources... oh someone made a change in Dataverse while you were editing it at the same time and getting an alert when saving in vscode and prompting if you want to do a diff on the file change before you commit. Just making Dataverse easier to work with and bridging the gaps where people waste time. efficiency is key time is finite, why waste it on semantics when you can just start ahead of the game? thats the concept. I'm not trying to say I'm doing everything perfectly and I am sure that I will continue to ship bugs when I break something

I've been building tooling, ALM, working with Data Migrations and Integrations, Portals, Replaced AS400 sytems, wrote plugins, architected high throughput integrations. The first version of PPDS was in the form of a VS Code extension written in TypeScript, talking to Dataverse over the Web API. It worked, but it wasn't right.

In December 2025, I worked on it but i did so in parallel with a bit of a new idea, i had an epifany. if I build the tool in a language that I'm more comfortable with and really accelerate my development with Claude doing most of the work(I read a lot of code but I don't write much anymore) and started over... the first commit was made on **first commit date for pds << this is important i want this in** **meta: the problem was my development wasn't fast enough and when i realized that a lot of the difficulty working around the web api could be solved by taking a depency on the Dataverse SDK it made the development a lot 1) faster 2) easier to work with and would enable me to build a lower level tool that could be used anywhere. you want to run a data migration? CMT was great in 2011 **not trying to dig at microsoft but we need to be somewhat honest need advice on this** but it doesn't cut the chut today *rick and morty reference? ok? not? fact check me on if thats the quote from rick and morty** the vision of PPDS

The core idea: bridge the gaps where people waste time. Time is finite. Why fight the tooling when you could just start building?

I'm building this in the open. It's not perfect, and I'll ship bugs. But I'd rather ship something useful and iterate than wait for perfect.

**[CLAUDE NOTES:
- Moved feature list (solutions, import jobs, diff alerts) to "What This Is" section
- "First commit Dec 14 2025" from your session context—confirm and I'll add
- The epiphany question is key—that's your hook]**
