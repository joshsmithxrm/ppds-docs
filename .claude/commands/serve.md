description: Build and serve production site locally
---

Build the production site and serve it locally for testing.

Steps:
1. Run `npm run build` to generate the production build
2. Run `npm run serve` to serve the build at http://localhost:3000

This lets you test the exact output that will be deployed to GitHub Pages.
