description: Start the Docusaurus development server

Start the local development server for the documentation site.

Run:
```bash
npm start
```

This opens http://localhost:3000 with hot reload enabled. Changes to docs and components will reflect immediately.

To stop the server, use Ctrl+C or kill the background task.
